# Project 2 - Composite Indicators - 

*Ferdi / Edgar / Natan*
*[DA, Paris & 05/22]*

## Description 

We created a compositite indicator from R&D and economic statistics.

The data was scraped from the World Bank database via an API wrapper.

Our composite indicator was made using the following:
- Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)
- High-technology exports (% of manufactured exports)
- Scientific and technical journal articles
- Patent applications, residents
- Patent applications, nonresidents

The 10 countries selected are European with the addition of the US, Japan, and Israel as outliers for comparison.
We attempted to screen for a contrast between Southern & Northern Europe.
